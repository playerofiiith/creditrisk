			<h1> Credit Risk Evaluation Application </h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					This application helps a loan granting officer of a
					bank or financial organisation to evaluate the loan applications.
					This helps in making decisions with regard to the applied loans.<br>
					<b>Background: </b>Risk for the applied loan can be evaluated using
					three methods - Rule based, Statistical based and Machine Learning based.
					Rule based models rely on well defined rules to judge a use case while
					Statistical and Machine Learning models rely on the data of other
					previously given loans. A decision can be suggested in this case by analysis
					of this data.<br> 
					<b>Usage of the application: </b>Points to note while using the application:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Users: </b>There are two users of the application: Loan Administrator and
							Loan Officer. Loan Admin is responsible for setting rules for the rule
							based model and adding dataset for statistical and ML based models.
							Loan Officer can add the dataset for testing the loan applicants and
							choose to see the results for a loan id using any of the three models
							for evaluation.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Setting rules: </b> For rule based model, add features using the "Add 
							Feature" screen, configure the feature using "Configuration" screen
							with a weightage between 0 and 1 such that weightages of all the features 
							add to 1. Then, set criteria for a feature using "Criteria" screen.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Setting criteria: </b> 
							<ul>
								<li>
									Select the feature, product and category from the dropdown lists in the
									"Criteria" screen. 
								</li>
								<li>
									Select the data source. If it is XML/JSON, specify the source url in
									API and provide the key. If it is SQL,	write the SQL query from the
									database named "db". e.g. "SELECT loan_amnt from db". You need not
									provide key for SQL.
								</li>
								<li>
									Set criterias and their scores. If the feature is categorical, set
									criteria using "is feature_name". e.g. For a feature say "gender",
									set the score for criteria "is Male" and "is Female" differently.  
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Uploading datasets: </b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									For uploading dataset of customers who have applied for loan, just 
									uplaod a ".csv" file in the "Upload Dataset" screen of Loan Officer.
								</li>
								<li>
									For uploading dataset for training, upload a ".csv" file in "Upload 
									Dataset" screen of Loan Admin.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Seeing Results: </b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									You can see the results by entering a loan id and 
									checking any of the models in the "Scorecard" screen of the Loan 
									Officer if	the screen shows that the model is ready for analysis.
								</li>
								<li>
									The rule based model gives the score (between 1-10) according to the
									specified rules.
								</li>
								<li>
									The statistical and machine learning based models give probability of
									approval of the loan according to the best machine learning/statistical
									model implemented.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
